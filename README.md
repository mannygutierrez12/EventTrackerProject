# EventTrackerProject

We have been tasked with creating a project of our choice that focuses on tracking events. For this project, I have decided to create an appointment tracker app. The main reason behind this choice is that I often tend to forget appointments, meetings, birthday parties, and other events. To address this issue, I will create a small table called "appointment" where I can input and retrieve data. 

The project will be divided into two sprints using the Agile methodology.

## First Spring
During the first sprint of the project, our task is to create and test the API only.

## Second Spring
In the second week of the project, we will be responsible for creating a fully functional CRUD application using HTML and JavaScript.

## Technologies
- Java
- Git
- Spring Boot
- REST API
- Gradle
- Spring Data JPA
- MySQL Workbench
- Postman

## Lessons Learned
We have been able to build upon the knowledge we acquired in the last two weeks and continue to polish our skills. I believe it was beneficial to have the opportunity to create a project using our own guidelines. This approach encourages creativity and allows us to think outside the box.

## Potential Modifications
For this project, I have initially decided to use just one table. However, it would be a great idea to use multiple tables for address, places, individuals we are taking to the appointment with us, and a miscellaneous table for random information.
